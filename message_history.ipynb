Short-term memory is used for temporary storage of information, such as remembering a phone number or a list of items. Long-term memory is used for storing information for a longer period of time, such as memories from childhood or important facts and knowledge. Working memory is used for actively processing and manipulating information, such as solving a math problem or following instructions. The type of memory to use depends on the task at hand. For example, if you need to remember something for a short period of time, short-term memory would be most appropriate. If you need to store information for a longer period of time, long-term memory would be more suitable. And for tasks that require active processing, working memory would be the best choice.\n",
